## Detailed Analysis: container-errors.spec.ts

### Performance Issues

- **Total Runtime**: 38.16 seconds (target: <5 seconds)
- **Failed Tests**: 13 out of 19 tests
- **Common Failure**: Tests expecting "Setup Required" but getting "Choose Theme"

### Specific Test Failures

#### UI Text Mismatch Failures

```
❌ "expected 'Choose Theme' to contain 'Setup Required'"
```

**Affected Tests**:

- should handle container with existing content (62ms)
- should handle error UI in different container types (52ms)
- should handle container with deeply nested structure (53ms)

#### Timeout Failures (6+ seconds each)

```
❌ "Error UI not found within 3000ms after 30 attempts (CI: false)"
```

**Affected Tests**:

- should display comprehensive error information (6058ms)
- should maintain accessibility in error UI (6055ms)

#### Logic Failures

```
❌ "You must provide a Promise to expect() when using .resolves, not 'undefined'."
```

**Affected Tests**:

- should handle container removal after initialization (50ms)
- should handle multiple initialization attempts on same container (100ms)

### Root Causes Identified

1. **UI Implementation Changed**: Tests expect "Setup Required" error UI, but actual implementation shows:
   - Success case: Theme switcher with "Choose Theme" text
   - Error case: "Viewer Creation Failed" text

2. **Excessive Timeouts**: Tests use 3000ms (3 second) waits that become 6+ second hangs

3. **waitForErrorUI Selector Issues**: Function can't find expected error elements

4. **Promise Handling**: Some tests have incorrect async/await patterns

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Document All Tests

- [x] container-errors.spec.ts documented
- [ ] Test zero-config.integration.test.ts
- [ ] Test config-errors.spec.ts

### Phase 2: Fix UI Text Expectations

- Update assertions from "Setup Required" to actual UI text
- Verify what error UI actually looks like in different scenarios

### Phase 3: Optimize Timeouts

- Reduce 3000ms waits to 500-1000ms
- Add CI-specific shorter timeouts

### Phase 4: Fix Selector Patterns

- Update waitForErrorUI to match actual DOM structure
- Fix Promise handling issues

### Phase 5: Verification

- All tests should pass
- All tests should complete in <5 seconds total
- Maintain comprehensive error scenario coverage

---

## Expected Outcome

- **Before**: 38+ seconds, 13 failures
- **After**: <5 seconds, 0 failures
- **CI Impact**: Reliable integration test execution
