# UI Improvements Needed

## 1. Navigation Categories Arrow Direction Fixed ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Issue**: Arrow pointed wrong direction when collapsed
**Fix**: Changed from ▼ to ▶ and adjusted rotation logic

## 2. Navigation State Persistence ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Issue**: Navigation categories don't remember their collapsed/expanded state when switching documents
**Fix**: Added localStorage persistence for category states

## 3. Search Input Theme Transition ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Issue**: Search input color changes are delayed when theme changes
**Fix**: Added transitions for background-color and color properties

## 4. Excessive Space Between Navigation and Content ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Issue**: Too much space between navigation pane and main content area
**Fix**: Reduced `.mdv-document` padding from 32px to 16px (unit _ 4 to unit _ 2)

## 5. Collapsible Navigation Pane for Desktop ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Issue**: Navigation pane should be collapsible on desktop, not just mobile
**Fix**: Added comprehensive desktop sidebar collapse functionality:

- ✅ Added toggle button to sidebar header (visible only on desktop)
- ✅ Implemented smooth width transition animation
- ✅ Added localStorage persistence for collapse state
- ✅ Content area automatically expands when sidebar is collapsed
- ✅ Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+B) for toggle
- ✅ Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
- ✅ Arrow icon changes direction based on state (▶ collapsed, ◀ expanded)

## 6. Navigation Categories Start Collapsed

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Issue**: Categories should start collapsed by default for better space usage
**Fix**: Changed default aria-expanded to "false" and added hidden attribute

## All Tasks Completed! ✅

All UI improvements have been successfully implemented and tested:

1. ✅ **Navigation arrow direction fixed** - Categories now use proper directional arrows
2. ✅ **Navigation state persistence** - Category expand/collapse states are preserved
