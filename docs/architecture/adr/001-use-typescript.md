# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide on the primary development language for the Markdown Docs Viewer library. The choice will impact developer experience, maintainability, and adoption.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript as the primary development language for the entire codebase.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **IDE Support**: Excellent IntelliSense and refactoring capabilities
- **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Developer Experience**: Better autocomplete and error detection
- **Refactoring**: Safer large-scale code changes
- **API Contracts**: Clear interfaces for public APIs

### Negative

- **Build Complexity**: Requires compilation step
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need TypeScript knowledge
- **Bundle Size**: Type declarations add to package size
- **Build Time**: Slightly slower builds due to compilation

### Neutral

- **Ecosystem**: Most modern libraries use TypeScript
- **Community**: Large TypeScript community for support

## Implementation

- Use TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- Generate declaration files for library consumers
- Configure tsconfig.json for ES2020 target
- Use type-only imports where possible to reduce bundle size
